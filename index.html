                                    <p>This was his first battle as Master of the Army. Him and four other commanders had to
                                        defend the fortress at Thannuris. This battle was a horrible defeat for Rome as two
                                        of their commanders fell and Belisarius and the other had to flee their remaining
                                        forces to the city of Dara. Although, it was a purric victory for the Persians, for
                                        they lost over 5000 Persian Immortals.</p>

                                        the only battle he ever lost. This one lost is the reason some historians do not
